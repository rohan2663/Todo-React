React To-Do App
This is a simple To-Do application built using React. The app allows users to:

Add tasks to a to-do list.
Mark tasks as completed using a checkbox.
Delete tasks from the list.
Persist tasks using localStorage, so the data remains after a browser refresh.
Features
Add New Tasks: Users can add tasks to the to-do list.
Mark as Complete: Users can mark tasks as complete by using the checkbox next to each task.
Delete Tasks: A delete button is provided to remove tasks from the list.
Persistent Storage: The app uses localStorage to store the tasks, ensuring that the tasks remain even after a page refresh or reopening the browser.

Usage
Adding a Task: Enter a task in the input field and press the "Add" button to add it to your list.
Marking a Task as Complete: Use the checkbox next to each task to mark it as complete. Completed tasks will be visually distinguished.
Deleting a Task: Click the delete button (üóëÔ∏è) next to a task to remove it from the list.
Persistent Data: The tasks will be stored in localStorage and will persist even after a page refresh or reopening the browser.

Technologies Used
React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
HTML5 & CSS3: For structuring and styling the app.
localStorage: To store tasks persistently in the browser.
